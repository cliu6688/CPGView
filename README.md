Introducing CPGView: A Comprehensive and Interactive Chloroplast Genome Visualization Platform

In the realm of molecular biology and plant genetics, the study of chloroplast genomes has become increasingly important in understanding various aspects of plant evolution, ecology, and biotechnology. While several chloroplast genome visualization tools exist, they typically only display the circular map of the chloroplast genome and gene distribution. Unfortunately, these tools lack the ability to present the intricate structure of the transcripts, hindering the process of evaluating annotation quality and gaining deeper insights.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Chloroplast Genome Viewer (CPGView), a user-friendly and comprehensive platform designed to visualize splicing genes within chloroplast genomes. CPGView offers a range of advanced features that allow researchers to not only examine gene distribution but also explore the detailed transcript structures with ease. The interactive interface and customizable options enable users to tailor their visualization experience, providing a more in-depth understanding of chloroplast genome organization and structure.
